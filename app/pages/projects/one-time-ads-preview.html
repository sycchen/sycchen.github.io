        Ads have been on every website for as long as I can remember, and they have become more and more intrusive, but
        it's also the only way that some sites generate any revenue. I've written a simple wrapper that will ad an X
        button to close ads! The hope is that it will encourage people to turn off their ad-blockers.

        <b>What does it do?</b>
        <br>
        Simple put your ad inside it and an overlay with an X button will be added to the ad. It will delete the ad
        from the page when clicked and the Ad won't show for future visits to this page!
