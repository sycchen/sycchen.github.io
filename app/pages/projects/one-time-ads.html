    <p>
        <b>How does it work?</b>
        <br>
        It uses javascript and cookies to determine if the ad should be displayed or not. Using the lifetime of a cookie,
        you can even control how long until the ad should be shown to the user again. This can all be controlled through
        some simple configurations.

        I chose to implement it this way so that future visits to the site will not have to load the Ad which could
        potentially make your site faster for your frequent viewers.

        Below is an ad for you to try it on. Simply click the x button in the top right corner to delete it. Try
        refreshing the page, you'll find the ad is still gone.

    <p>
        <b>How do I get it?</b>
        <br>
        Easy, simply copy paste some code! First you surround your ad in this div.
        <pre>
&ltdiv style="position: relative;"&gt
    &ltdiv id="example_ad_1" class="one-time-ad"&gt
        &lt!--
            Your Ad Code Here
        --&gt
    &lt/div&gt
    &ltdiv class="one-time-ad-wrap" onClick="markAsClicked('example_ad_1')"
         style="position:absolute; top: 0; right: 0; width: 15px; height: 15px; cursor: pointer; cursor: hand;"&gt
        &#10006&lt/div&gt
&lt/div>
        </pre>
        Please remember to give it a unique ID, there are two instances of "example_ad_1" that should be replaced with
        a unique name. You can leave the rest untouched. Between the <code>&lt!-- --&gt</code> is where you place the div
        of your ad.

        <br><br>

        You'll also need to include this javascript code in your website: <a href="/app/pages/projects/one-time-ads.js">one-time-ads.js</a>.
        Simply save the file and include it like so:
        <pre>
&lthtml&gt
    ...
    &lthead&gt
        ...
        &ltscript type="text/javascript" src="one-time-ads.js"&gt&lt/script&gt
        ...
        </pre>

        There are also an options you can change in the javascript if you choose to. Inside the file you should see
        <code>var cookieLifetime = null;</code>. You can change the null into any number. This will be the number of
        days until the cookie is expired and the ad will show again.
    </p>

        <b>Getting it to work with AngularJS views</b>
        <br>
        Since my site uses AngularJS to perform partial loads, the listener no longer works. To solve this, I created a
        directive which does the same thing as the listener would.
        <pre>
.directive('oneTimeAd', function() {
    return {
        link: function(scope, element, attrs) {
            if (readCookie(cookiePrefix + element[0].id) == null) {
                // Replace comment with html
                for (const child of element[0].childNodes) {
                    if (child.nodeType == Node.COMMENT_NODE) {
                        element[0].innerHTML = child.data;
                        break;
                    }
                }
            } else {
                // Delete the element
                element[0].parentElement.parentElement.removeChild(element[0].parentElement);
                i--;
            }
        }
    };
})
        </pre>
        You'll also need to add a tag for the directive to work as shown below.
        <pre>
&ltdiv id="example_ad_1" class="one-time-ad" one-time-ad&gt
        </pre>
    </p>
</div>
