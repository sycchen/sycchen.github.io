                <h4>Road Trip</h4>
                My recent proudest moment is my road-trip across Canada and the USA. Together with 2 friends, we
                braved the snowy roads from Toronto to Seattle and Vancouver. Sought warmth as we headed south towards
                San Diego. Then returned home playing in the hot deserts on the way.

                My mother has instilled a love for books into me. From when I was a child when she would read to me till
                now on my phone and laptop, I've always enjoyed reading. My favorite author is <a href="">Piers Anthony</a>
                and his Xanth series. Recently I've begun to read light novels (mostly chinese xianxia) that have been
                translated into english.

                <h4>Games</h4>
                Probably my oldest is gaming. My favorite genres are RPG and JRPG since i enjoy the stories and the sense
                of progression from leveling up. Online games will also always have a place in my heart for all the
                friends and cool people I've met playing them. Games I like off the top of my head are: Tales Series,
                Dragon Age, Audition, and Diablo.

                <h4>Board Games and D&D</h4>
                Stemming from my gaming hobby is dungeons and dragons. To me it's like a game on pen and paper. It
                usually ends up being somewhat silly and everyone gets to enjoy doing what they want. It also makes many
                fun stories to tell. I also enjoy interesting board games. My friends and I would always find new ones
                to try out.

                Though not the most active person, from time to time I enjoy some physical activities such as indoor
                rock climbing, biking or swimming.
